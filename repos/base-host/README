This repository contains dummy implementations of platform-specific Genode APIs
to enable the compilation of Genode for the host platform. Because the
repository provides only dummy implementations, most of the generated binaries
will not work. However, the repository serves two important purposes. It
documents the platform- specific APIs that must be filled out when porting
Genode to another platform, and it is the build environment for unit tests
executed on the host platform.
