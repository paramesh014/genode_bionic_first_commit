# This is a pseudo library for letting programs use stdc++ headers by adding
# 'stdcxx' to the 'LIBS' declaration. The actual support for incorporating
# the C++ standard library resides in 'lib/import/import-stdcxx.mk'. This
# file merely exists to resolve the build dependency to the 'stdcxx' library
# description file.
