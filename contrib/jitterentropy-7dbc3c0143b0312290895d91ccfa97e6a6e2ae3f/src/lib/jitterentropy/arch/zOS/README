z/OS implementation
===================

The code in this directory is needed to compile the CPU Jitter random number
generator for z/OS. Consider the following hints:

- copy gettime.s into directory with jitterentropy-base.c

- add "#pragma LANGLVL(EXTENDED) RUNOPTS(ALL31(ON),TRAP(ON),TERM(DUMP))" to every C file that is going to be compiled
  as a first statement  before any C code statement

- copy jitterentropy-base-user.h over the same file in jitterentropy/

- use the attached Makefile
