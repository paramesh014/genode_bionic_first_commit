Kernel files
------------
jitterentropy-base-kernel.h -- Kernel helper functions needed for entropy
			       collection

jitterentropy-dbg.c        -- DebugFS interface allow user space to interact
			      with entropy collector, defines 2 DRNGs
			      and interacts with the DRNG handler (note, that is
			      intended to support debugging only, file does not
			      need to be compiled, the switch is
			      CONFIG_JITTERENTROPY_DBG)
			      (design given in appendix B)
jitterentropy-dbg.h        -- internal API for jitterentropy-dbg-kernel.c
			      exported to other C files

jitterentropy-drng.c        -- implementation of the DRNG handling for the
			       entropy collector and this C file implements the
			       kernel module logic
			       (design given in appendix B)
jitterentropy-drng.h        -- DRNG data structure and internal API exported
			       by the DRNG component

jitterentropy-kcapi.c        -- Register regular and strong DRNG with kernel
				crypto API to provide a the CPU Jitter RNG
				whitenend by a DRNG as a non-physical true
				random number generator to the kernel. In
				addition, provide direct access to the CPU
				Jitter RNG.
				(design given in appendix B)
jitterentropy-kcapi.h        -- export the init and exit functions
