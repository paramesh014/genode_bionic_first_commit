CPU Jitter random number generator OpenSSL Engine support
=========================================================

The following engines are available:

jitterentropy-raw -- direct access to the CPU Jitter random number generator

jitterentropy-drng -- access to the OpenSSL default DRNG which is seeded
		      with 16 bytes from the CPU Jitter random number generator
		      after 1<<10 and with 48 bytes after 1<<20 bytes.

jitterentropy-strong -- access to the OpenSSL default DRNG which is seeded
			with 16 bytes from the CPU Jitter random number
			generator after 16 and with 48 bytes after 1<<10 bytes.


The jitterentropy-drng and jitterentropy-strong engines can be registered
as default RNGs with ENGINE_set_default_RAND.
